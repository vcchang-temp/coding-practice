# Coding Practice

This repo is just for me to host my solutions to interview coding questions. I write the solutions in Python (which I am learning at the same time as I am practicing these coding questions).

Questions are arranged by category:
* [Arrays](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Arrays)
* [2D Arrays](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/2D%Arrays)
* [Binary Trees](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Binary%20Trees)
* [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Binary%20Search%20Trees)
* [Graphs](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Graphs)
* [Linked Lists](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Linked%20Lists)
* [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Misc)
* [N-ary Trees](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/N-ary%20Trees)
* [Recursion](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Recursion)
* [Sorting](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Sorting)
* [Strings](https://github.com/vcchang/coding-practice/tree/master/Strings)
